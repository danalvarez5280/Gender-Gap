This gear up was the most eye opening and inspiring gear up. I was completely unaware of the blatant sexism in the coding industry. It also made me think back to a student's lightning talk about we can't make the ipod before we get the technology to of the battery used to power the ipod. A big debate about hiring more women in programming is that we should hire the best possible candidate. However like the ipod needing the battery before we can make the ipod out of the best parts, we can't be expected to hire the best candidate, if our field of applicants doesn't include the best individuals. So we need more women and minorities in the tech industry otherwise how will we ever know if we have hired the best candidate out there.
